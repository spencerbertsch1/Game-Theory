## To run the code: 

1. Clone [this github repository](https://github.com/spencerbertsch1/Game-Theory) locally and `cd` into the `Game-Theory` directory. 
Alternatively, if you acquired this code from a zip file, simply unzip the file locally, `cd` into the `Game-Theory` directory, and continue to Step 2. 
In order to run any of the test scripts in this repository, you will need python 3. 
   1. If you don't have python 3 installed, you can install Anaconda and create a new Conda environment using the following command:
      1. `$ conda create -n game_theory_env python=3.9`
   2. Then activate the new environment by running the following command:
       1. `$ conda activate game_theory_env`
   3. Then process to the following step. 
   

2. `cd` to the assignment_1 directory by running the following command:
   1. `$ cd assignment_1`


3. Run the following command to run the nim_player.py file. 
   1. `$ python3 nim_player.py`

4. Run the following command to run the g_calc.py file. This file reads in a representation of a directed graph and computed the g-value of each vertex 
   1. `$ python3 g_calc.py`


4. You will see the output of each algorithm after running each of the python files.
