# T-GAN

Value add: 
- Places the TAB-GAN or CTAB-GAN inside a learning loop and only keeps the new data that improves performance. If no performance improvement is seen or if improvement gets worse, then it returns the original data set. 
- If performance improves, then it returns the larger data set. 
- We can do this automatically or in an intelligently engineered way.
